This is the starting point for the birthday wish automator.

## Setup
1. Download the zip file from above > extract it > open the folder in your preferred code editor.
2. Open your cmd(windows) or terminal (mac/linux/wsl) and run
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
3. **In the folder of the code, make a virtual environment** 
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```
4. Now, we'll activate out virtual environment.
   1. For windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate.bat```
   2. For literally any other OS: ```source venv/bin/activate```
5. Hey, you're almost there :)   
    Now, we'll install the python packages to get our code running.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### And you're all done!
